# Purpose
To familiarize myself with the golang programming language (again)

# Goal of the Program
To come up with a schedule of matchday fixtures for a league (e.g. a football league with 20 teams). 
- Each team plays the other once in a season (home and away concept is present, but the reverse fixtures have not been explicitly computed)
- Each team plays once on a matchday
- All teams play on a matchday
